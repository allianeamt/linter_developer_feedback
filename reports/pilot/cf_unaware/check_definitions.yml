    check_name: S3 Lifecycle Configurations
    description: |
      Verifies that S3 buckets have lifecycle configurations with at least one rule defined. Missing rules 
      may lead to data retention in expensive storage indefinitely, thus increasing costs.
    recommendations:
      - Define LifecycleConfiguration in the Properties section of the bucket.
      - Include a non-empty Rules list with expiration/transition logic.
