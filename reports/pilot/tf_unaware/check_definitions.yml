    description: |
      Verifies that aws_s3_bucket resources have lifecycle configurations defined via lifecycle_rules or as 
      a linked aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration. Missing rules may lead to data retention in expensive 
      storage indefinitely, thus increasing costs.
    recommendations:
      - Add a lifecycle_rule block inside the S3 bucket for a compact definition of simple rules.
      - Link the S3 bucket to a separate aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration resource for complex or interdependent rules.
